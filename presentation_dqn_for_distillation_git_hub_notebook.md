# Presentation — Reinforcement Learning (DQN) for Distillation (GitHub notebook)

---

# Slide 1 — Title

**Title:** Reinforcement Learning for Distillation Column — Code Walkthrough & Review

**Source file:** `/mnt/data/eaf3ebd0-7d5c-42be-ba0a-e2bfc1c9c669.ipynb` (original notebook uploaded)

**Prepared:** Detailed walkthrough & suggested next steps for the GitHub code

---

# Slide 2 — Executive summary

- **Goal:** Train a Reinforcement Learning agent (Deep Q-Network) to control a distillation column using logged/process data.
- **Approach used in the notebook:** Offline RL style approach using dataset episodes, discrete action bins for reflux ratio, and a simple feedforward DQN (TensorFlow / Keras).
- **Notebook status:** well-commented scaffold with extensive EDA, problem decomposition and many pragmatic suggestions — several implementation placeholders (`...`) remain where production code / environment objects should be.

---

# Slide 3 — Notebook high-level structure

1. Load dataset and initial inspection (CSV: `distillation_rl_dataset.csv`).
2. Exploratory data analysis (descriptive statistics, plots using `matplotlib`/`seaborn`).
3. Data preprocessing suggestions and missing-value handling.
4. Define RL environment components: state space, action space, reward.
5. DQN model architecture (Keras Sequential) and hyperparameters.
6. Training loop outline (epsilon-greedy, replay buffer, target network updates).
7. Evaluation strategy (last 10% episodes, reward/quality/energy metrics).
8. Iterated refinements (hyperparams, state/action expansions).

---

# Slide 4 — Data (what the notebook expects)

The notebook reads a CSV (`df = pd.read_csv('/content/distillation_rl_dataset.csv')`) and expects episode-structured logs. Suggested/mentioned columns include:

- `episode_id`, `timestep` (or timestamp), `feed_flow_kg_s`, `feed_light_frac`, `feed_temp_K`
- `tray_pressure_bar`, `tray_pressure_drop_bar`, `hold_up_kg`
- `top_product_purity`, `bottom_product_purity` (or `quality_score_0_1`)
- `energy_consumption_kW`, `reboiler_duty_kW`, `condenser_duty_kW`
- control/action logs: `reflux_ratio_action`, `previous_reflux_ratio`, `valve_position_percent`, `pump_speed_rpm`
- extras: disturbance flags, time-of-day features, history aggregates (e.g., `reflux_history_mean_last5`)
- **reward column used by notebook:** `immediate_reward`

(If your actual CSV differs, update state/action column names accordingly.)

---

# Slide 5 — State & action design (notebook's proposal)

**State space (example):** a vector of process variables at the current timestep. The notebook suggests a selectable subset (feed, internals, product purities, energy metrics, previous control actions, simple historical aggregates).

**Action space (proposal):** discretize reflux ratio into `n` bins. Every discrete action corresponds to setting the reflux ratio to a representative bin value.

**Reward:** immediate per-timestep reward provided by dataset (`immediate_reward`), which is a convenient choice for offline RL; recommend checking its formulation (purity/energy trade-off, penalties for poor control).

---

# Slide 6 — DQN architecture (as in notebook)

Snippet (paraphrased from the notebook):

```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def create_dqn_model(input_shape, num_actions):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Input(shape=(input_shape,)),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(num_actions, activation='linear')  # Q-values for each discrete action
    ])
    return model
```

**Notes:** simple 2-layer MLP; appropriate baseline, but consider normalization of inputs, dropout/batchnorm only if needed, and exploring dueling / double DQN variants.

---

# Slide 7 — Training loop (detailed pseudocode)

**What must be implemented (not fully in the notebook):**

1. Build replay buffer (deque) to store `(state, action, reward, next_state, done)`.
2. For each episode:
   - Reset (take first row of episode in offline setting).
   - For each timestep:
     - Select action via epsilon-greedy (explore with probability `epsilon`, else `argmax Q(state)`).
     - Observe `next_state`, `reward`, and `done` from dataset (offline: use logged transitions).
     - Store transition in replay buffer.
     - If buffer size >= `batch_size`: sample minibatch and perform gradient step:
       - `target = reward + gamma * max_a' Q_target(next_state, a') * (1 - done)`
       - Compute loss = MSE(Q(state, action), target) (or Huber loss)
       - Backprop on online Q-network
     - Periodically copy weights to target network every `update_target_network_freq` steps.
   - Decay epsilon: `epsilon = max(epsilon_min, epsilon * epsilon_decay)`

**Important:** for offline dataset you must ensure transitions are taken in the logged order of each episode; if data are deterministic logs rather than an actual environment, do not sample invalid next states.

---

# Slide 8 — Loss, targets and numerics

- **Bellman target (DQN):**

\( y_i = r_i + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{target}(s_{i+1}, a') \)

- Use a **target network** to stabilize training.
- Loss: Mean Squared Error (or Huber) between \(Q_{online}(s_i, a_i)\) and \(y_i\).
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate suggested `1e-3` in notebook). Tune this.
- Gradient clipping and batch normalization can help stability.

---

# Slide 9 — Evaluation strategy (notebook + recommendations)

Notebook uses the last 10% of episodes for evaluation. Metrics recommended:

- **Average total reward per episode** (primary RL metric)
- **Average product purity (top/bottom) per timestep or per episode**
- **Average energy consumption (kW) per timestep or per episode**
- **Trade-off curves**: purity vs energy
- **Learning curves**: total reward vs episode (plot time series)

Visualization code in the notebook uses `matplotlib` to plot `episode_rewards` over time — extend with boxplots, moving-average smoothing, and confidence intervals across multiple seeds.

---

# Slide 10 — Missing / incomplete pieces I found

These are *actionable* gaps to complete before running/train reliably:

- Several cells contain `...` placeholders; core implementations are not present (experience replay ops, exact training step, environment `step()` logic if needed).
- `state_space_cols` and `action_bins` are suggested but not fully enumerated in one runnable cell (they appear as examples/comments).
- No formal `Env` class (e.g., `gym.Env`) is instantiated — the notebook relies on dataset slicing instead. That’s OK for an offline approach, but needs careful handling of logged transition ordering.
- Missing consistent seed-setting for reproducibility (`numpy`, `random`, `tensorflow` seeds).
- Model saving/loading utilities (`model.save()` / `model.load_weights()`) and checkpointing during training.
- No unit tests or CI; no `requirements.txt`.

---

# Slide 11 — Concrete code & repo hygiene recommendations (GitHub)

1. **Add `requirements.txt`** (minimum: `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow>=2.x`).
2. **Add README** with: how to run notebook, dataset expectations, how to reproduce results.
3. **Add small sample of the dataset** (or generator) so reviewers can run the notebook quickly.
4. **Modularize code:** move model, replay buffer, utils into `.py` modules and keep the notebook as an experiment runner.
5. **Add checkpoints & logs:** TensorBoard or Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.
6. **Unit tests:** at least for data loading and environment step logic.

---

# Slide 12 — Performance improvements & RL algorithm suggestions

- Try **Double DQN** and **Dueling DQN** to reduce overestimation bias.
- Consider **Prioritized Experience Replay** to speed learning.
- If action space is naturally continuous, evaluate **SAC** or **TD3** instead of discretizing.
- For strictly offline data consider **offline RL algorithms** (Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), BEAR, etc.) or libraries like `d3rlpy`.
- Use **hyperparameter sweeps** (Optuna, Ray Tune) for learning rate, gamma, batch size, network width.

---

# Slide 13 — Reproducibility & runtime notes

- **Seed everything** (`np.random.seed`, `random.seed`, `tf.random.set_seed`).
- **Hardware:** training is faster on GPU. The notebook is compatible with Colab GPU (enable runtime→GPU).
- **Checkpointing:** save models periodically; include the best model by validation reward.
- **Data scaling:** normalize inputs per-feature (mean/std from training episodes) and persist scalers.

---

# Slide 14 — Safety, domain & deployment considerations

- Verify that the offline dataset is representative of all operating regimes.
- Evaluate safety constraints explicitly (do not deploy policies that can command unsafe reflux ratios without safety checks).
- Sim-to-real: if deploying to a live controller, use conservative deployment: shadow mode → human-in-the-loop → staged automation.

---

# Slide 15 — Suggested next steps (short roadmap)

1. Implement the missing environment and training steps in the notebook or refactor into Python modules.
2. Add sample dataset and `requirements.txt`, a README and `run.sh` for quick start.
3. Run small experiments (short training) to sanity-check learning curves.
4. Add model checkpoints, logging, and unit tests.
5. Explore algorithmic improvements (Double/ Dueling / offline RL).

---

# Appendix A — Quick runnable checklist (to get results locally)

1. Create virtual env and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Place `distillation_rl_dataset.csv` in notebook root or adjust path.
3. Run the notebook top-to-bottom; for heavy training switch to a GPU runtime.
4. If you want a script-based run, wrap the training loop in `train.py` and call `python train.py --episodes 200`.

---

# Appendix B — Cell-by-cell review highlights (selected)

- **Data load cell:** good — ensure robust path handling and `dtype` hints for large CSVs.
- **EDA cells:** helpful plots; recommend adding correlation heatmap and missing-value bar chart.
- **State space cell (placeholder):** finalize a concrete `state_space_cols` list and compute scalers.
- **Model cell:** create and compile model but notebook has placeholder `...` — ensure `q_network` and `target_network` variables are defined and compiled before training.
- **Training cell(s):** multiple places show the training loop pattern but not full implementation; implement replay buffer sampling + update.
- **Evaluation cells:** use final 10% episodes (good idea) and provide comparison plots.

---

# Final slide — Wrap-up

- I prepared a detailed presentation that explains the notebook's intent, what is implemented, what remains to be implemented, evaluation plans, and practical next steps for GitHub readiness.

- If you want, I can now:
  - Export this presentation as a **PowerPoint (.pptx)** file, OR
  - Produce a **concise README.md** tailored for the repository, OR
  - Convert the notebook into a runnable `train.py` + `evaluate.py` module structure.

Tell me which of the above you want next and I will produce it immediately.
